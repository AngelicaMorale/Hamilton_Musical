    <div class="acts">
        <p class="acts"> The musical opens with a prologue introducing Alexander Hamilton, an orphaned immigrant from
            the
            Caribbean who arrives in New York in 1776. We see his ambition and intelligence as he quickly makes
            connections
            with influential figures. The ensemble introduces key characters: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and
            Aaron
            Burr, who narrates parts of the story. </p>
        <p></p>

        <p class="acts"> Hamilton’s rise begins when he becomes an aide to Washington during the Revolutionary War. He
            plays a crucial
            role in battles and earns respect, showcasing his leadership and strategic thinking. As the war progresses,
            he
            meets and falls in love with Eliza Schuyler, and they marry, further entrenching him in the political
            landscape. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="acts"> The act highlights Hamilton's vision for America’s future. He advocates for a strong federal
            government and the
            establishment of a national bank, clashing with Jefferson, who favors states’ rights. This rivalry
            intensifies,
            reflecting the ideological divide in the new nation. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="acts"> Key moments include the publication of Hamilton's pamphlet "Federalist No. 10," which argues
            for a strong
            central government, and his relationship with his friend John Laurens, who advocates for abolition. The act
            culminates in the political maneuvering surrounding the capital's location, leading to the infamous dinner
            bargain between Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="acts"> The act concludes with the setup for the climactic duel between Hamilton and Burr, emphasizing
            the personal and
            political stakes involved.

    <h1>ACT II</h1>

    <div class="acts">
        <p class="acts"> The second act shifts focus to Hamilton's political career after the Revolution. He serves as
            the first Secretary of the Treasury and implements a series of controversial financial policies, including
            the assumption of state debts and the establishment of a national bank. These moves create tension,
            particularly with Jefferson and his supporters, who fear the centralization of power. </p>
        <p></p>

        <p class="acts"> Amidst his political successes, Hamilton faces personal turmoil. He becomes embroiled in a
            scandal involving Maria Reynolds, which he ultimately confesses to, damaging his reputation and straining
            his marriage with Eliza. This revelation illustrates the duality of his character: a brilliant politician
            grappling with personal flaws.</p>
        <p></p>

        <p class="acts"> As political divisions deepen, Burr becomes increasingly disillusioned and envious of
            Hamilton’s influence. Their rivalry escalates, leading to Burr challenging Hamilton to a duel. The climax
            occurs on the dueling grounds, where Hamilton is fatally shot. His death serves as a poignant moment,
            reflecting on the costs of ambition and the complexities of legacy. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="acts"> The musical concludes with a powerful reflection on Hamilton's life and contributions to the
            nation. Through Eliza's poignant memories and the ensemble's narrative, we see Hamilton's enduring impact,
            framed within themes of legacy, sacrifice, and the relentless pursuit of one's ideals. </p>
